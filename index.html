						Hello, i'm a french student at 
					<a class = "lien" href = "https://www.efrei.fr/" target="_blank" > EFREI PARIS </a>
						, an engenering school specialized in computer science. 
						I'm 18 and I create things during my free time. I really like developping programs in order to simplify tasks or apply my 
						knowledge of maths and physics.
						<br> <br>
						I am constantly trying to learn new things in science. For example, I'm currently focussing on neural network and 
						Conway's Game of Life (<a class="lien" href = "#projects">see my projects</a>).
						<br> <br>
						I am always looking for challenges by starting weirds and hards projects, and never limitating them by 
						my knowledge by doing deep search. Thus, i frequently learn new tools and technologies in order to finish them,
						and never give up. </p>
